Q-What is Lifting State?

In React, lifting state refers to the practice of moving state up to a common ancestor component
so that multiple child components can share and manage the same state. This is useful for
communication and synchronization between sibling components.

For example, in an Accordion component where each section can expand or collapse,
lifting the state to a common parent ensures only one section is open at a time.

# Accordion Working

1. State Management: The Accordion component keeps track of the active section using activeIndex.

2. Props Passing: The Accordion passes down the isActive prop to indicate if a section is open
and the onClick handler to toggle sections.

3. Toggle Logic:

If the same section is clicked, it closes (index becomes null).
If another section is clicked, it opens, and the previous one closes.

Output

Clicking on a section toggles its visibility.
Only one section is open at a time due to centralized state in the parent.
This separation of concerns and centralized state management is the essence of lifting state.
