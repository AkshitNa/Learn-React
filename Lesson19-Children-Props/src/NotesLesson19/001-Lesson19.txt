Q-What is Children?

In React, Children is a built-in prop that every React component receives by default.

It refers to everything passed between the opening and closing tags of a component.

It allows you to pass JSX (HTML-like code), strings, or even other components into a component.

Q-When to Use children?

To create reusable container components (like cards, modals, or layouts).
To pass and render dynamic content inside a component.

# Benefits of children

Flexibility: Pass anything (HTML, components, text) as children.
Reusability: Write one wrapper component and reuse it with different children.
Clean Code: Keeps the parent component simple while delegating layout/rendering to the child.
