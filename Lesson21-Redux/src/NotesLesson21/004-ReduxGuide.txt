# Redux Architecture

A) UI + Button click
B) Button click => Event occurs and it goes to Redux Store.
C) In Redux Store => "Redux Reducer [Another function] which managess all the Events related to a partiular SLICE is called.
D) The function inside Redux Reducer gets "called" and there is change in state of all the
component subscribed to Redux Store.

Note: Redux Reducer is a function which handles events.

Note: We keep states in Redux Store seperately and not in the component which is
using it.

Example: 

A) Counter Application UI + Button click
B) Button click => "onClick" event occurs and it goes to Redux Store.
C) In Redux Store => "Redux Reducer [Another function] which managess all the Events related to a partiular SLICE is called.
D) The function inside Redux Reducer [INCREMENT FUNCTION] gets "called" and there is change in state of all the
components subscribed to Redux Store. 

Eg: Say the value of counter state increases to 1 from 0.

Note: Redux Reducer is a function which handles events.

# Guide to Redux

1) Go to https://redux-toolkit.js.org/ and click on Get Started, here you can learn about it.

2) First install Redux toolkit => npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux

3) Create a "Redux folder", inside it create "Slices Folder", now 

Create a Slice => A Slice is basically a component which has special features like "State" and "ability to trigger an event",
for example "CounterSlice". 

Path =>> src -> Redux -> Slices -> Counter

Note:: Store is made up of Slices.

4) Create/Configure Redux Store [store.jsx] inside Redux folder.

5) Update our store.jsx file by adding the Slice.

6) Go to main.jsx and pass the store we have created.

7) Understand the Use of "useSelector" and  "useDispatch" ::

import {useDispatch, useSelector} from "react-redux"; 

useSelector => It is used to use the partiular state.

useDispatch => It is used to call the partiular function related to that state.

For example: In counterSlice the state id = initialState (777) and the functions associated to it are: INCREMENT and DECREMENT.

8) Now, call useDispatch and useSelector to use the SLICE in any component, we want freely.

Note: Now we can use the React-Redux to let React components interact with the Redux store.
We can read data from the store with useSelector, and dispatch actions using useDispatch.
