Q-What is Lifting State?

Ans: "Lifting State Up" is when you move the state to the closest common parent component so
that multiple components can share and use that same data.

Imagine you have two components that need to know the same information — like an input field
where you type your name, and another component that displays a greeting message based
on that name. If both components need the same data (the name),
it’s best to store that data in a parent component and "lift" it up so both child components can access it.

Simple Example

1. An InputComponent where you type a name.
2. A GreetingComponent that says "Hello, [name]" based on the input.
3. A ParentComponent that holds the shared state (the name) and passes it down to both components.
