GraphQL has two queries:

1) query => To select data
2> mutation => TO alter data [create, delete, update]

useQuery =>

<1> A hook for executing queries in an Apollo application.

<2> To run a query within a React component,
    call useQuery and pass it a GraphQL query document.

<3> When your component renders, useQuery returns an object from Apollo Client 
    that contains loading, error, and data properties you can use to render your UI.
