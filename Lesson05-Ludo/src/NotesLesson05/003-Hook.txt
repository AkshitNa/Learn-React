# Hook

Hook is a special function that lets you use state and other React features in functional components. 
Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 to provide state management and side effects in functional components,
which were previously only possible in class components.

Some common Hooks include:

(1) useState: Allows you to add state to functional components.
(2) useEffect: Lets you perform side effects, such as fetching data or updating the DOM, in functional components.

(3) useContext: Provides a way to access the context value in functional components.
(4) useReducer: Offers an alternative to useState for managing more complex state logic.

(5) useRef: Allows you to access and interact with DOM elements directly.

Hooks enable you to write cleaner, more reusable code by avoiding the complexities of
class components and lifecycle methods.
