# useState

In React, useState is a Hook that allows you to add state to functional components.
It lets you create state variables and functions to update them.
When you call useState, it returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update it.

You can use this function to change the state, and React will re-render the component to reflect the new state.
This makes useState essential for managing dynamic data, such as user inputs or API responses,
within functional components, enabling interactive and responsive user interfaces.
