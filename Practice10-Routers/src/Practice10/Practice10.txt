Navigation Bar

npm install react-router-dom

 In this lesson we will learn "Routing". It basically means Navigation [To achieve SPA].

1. Install react-router-dom: This library provides the tools for routing. Install it to begin setting up navigation.

2. Create Page Components: Make individual components for each page you want (e.g., Home, About, Clock).
These will represent different views in your app.

3. Define Routes with createBrowserRouter: Set up a route configuration where each path (URL)
links to a specific component. Optionally, add a default error component for unknown paths.

4. Create a Layout Component: This component includes any common elements (like a navigation bar).
Use Outlet as a placeholder where page-specific content will appear.

5. Add Navigation with Link Components: Inside the layout component, add Link
components for each route. These allow users to move between pages without reloading the app.

6. Enable Routing with RouterProvider: Wrap the app with RouterProvider and pass in the
router configuration. This activates routing throughout your app.
