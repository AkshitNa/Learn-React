# Before learning useEffect read the following: 

# React component lifecycle :

The React component lifecycle can be broken down into four main phases: 

<1> Initialization => This is the phase where a new component is set up for the first time. 
It involves setting up the initial state and any initial properties (props) that the component needs.

<2> Mounting => Mounting is when the component is being added to the DOM (the structure of the web page).

<3> Updating => Updating happens whenever there is a change in the componentâ€™s state or props, causing it to re-render.
Here, Virtual DOM and Real DOM are compared.

<4> Unmounting [Cleaning Up] => Unmounting is when the component is being removed from the DOM.

Note: These phases ensure that React components can manage their setup, updates, and
teardown processes efficiently and effectively.
