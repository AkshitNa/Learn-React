# Applications

A) When you want to run some code when your component first appears on the screen [MOUNT], you can use useEffect to do that.

Example: useEffectComponentA

2) You can use useEffect to run code when specific pieces of "state or props" change.

Example: useEffectComponentB

3) Sometimes you need to clean up resources (like subscriptions or timers) 
when your component is removed from the screen. useEffect can return a cleanup function to do this.

Example: useEffectComponentC
