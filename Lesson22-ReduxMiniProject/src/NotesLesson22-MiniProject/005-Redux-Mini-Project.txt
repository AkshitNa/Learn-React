Create CSS File   => Component.css [Note:: Jyada CSS Use Nahi Kri since I've BootStrap Framework]

4) Design "NavBar"

5) Design "ProductList"

6) Design "SingleProduct"

7) Let's Create our STORE::

A) Create ProductSlice and use Redux-Thunk for asyn API Calling.

B) Now, add store to main.jsx so it is accessible to all.

From now, our Application will be working fine.

C) Now, we will add the logic to add selective products to the cart [addToCart] and also
   remove them if we don't want it [removeFromCart].

D) Create CartCounterSlice and don't forget to import its value to "SingleProduct" and "NavBar [Cart Icon]"

Note: D) is the main part of this Application, do it carefully.

E) Congratulations!!
