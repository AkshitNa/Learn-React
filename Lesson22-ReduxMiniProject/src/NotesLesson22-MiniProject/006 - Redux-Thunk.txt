# Redux Thunk

1) Redux-Thunk is a middleware for Redux, it is present between your UI and Redux.

2) This is useful for handling asynchronous operations like API calls in a Redux application.

3) It's a way to delay actions in a Redux app => Instead of sending actions straight to the 
   reducer, it lets you first do some asynchronous work (like fetching data) and then send the action.

Note:: "reducers" are pure functions [Takes arguments and return something] and can not be asynchronous.
        It is a good practice to call API using under Reducers which is possible using Redux Thunk as it handles
        asynchronous functions and makes it synchronous for our "reducers".

4) Redux-Tool Kit automatically confugure Redux-Thunk as asynchronous middleware,
   we just need to import and implement it.

   npm install redux-thunk [No Need]

5) It has three functions: Pending (Loading), Fullfilled (Success) and Rejected (Error).
